		mdevd is a daemon managing kernel hotplug events, similarly to udevd.
		It uses the same configuration file as mdev, which is a hotplug
		manager integrated in the Busybox suite of tools. However, mdev
		needs to be registered as a hotplug manager and the kernel forks
		an instance of mdev for every event; by contrast, mdevd is a daemon
		listening to the netlink, and does not fork.
