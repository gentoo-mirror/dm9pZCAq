		ZetZ is for systems without dynamic memory,
		where C is and will remain the defacto standard system interface.
		
		Target bare metal MCUs, embedded linux, WASM,
		and embed it in other languages.

		You can also use it to build cross platform libraries,
		with a clean portable C-standard api.
		
		Zetz plays nice with others and does not require rewriting everything
		in zetz to be useful in large projects.

		A major innovative feature is that all code is formally verified by
		symbolic execution in a virtual machine, at compile time.
